# SRO_Intelligence

## Quick Summary
Surgical planning and intelligence system developed in collaboration with Dr. Carpenter. Includes pre-operative optimization tools for surgical readiness assessment and planning.

## Current Status
**Phase:** In Development
**Last Worked On:** January 18, 2026
**Health:** 🟡 Needs Attention (need to sync with Dr. Carpenter)

## The Goal
Comprehensive surgical intelligence platform:
- Pre-operative patient optimization
- Surgical planning workflows
- Risk assessment and mitigation

## Tech Stack / Tools
- TBD - need to review current codebase
- PreOp_Optimizer module now integrated

## Key Files & Locations
| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Project Folder | `02_Products\SRO_Intelligence` |
| PreOp Module | `02_Products\SRO_Intelligence\PreOp_Optimizer` |

## Current Task
**Next Step:** Schedule sync meeting with Dr. Carpenter to align on roadmap

**Details:**
- PreOp_Optimizer was just moved into this project
- Need to review integration points
- Clarify division of labor

## Collaborators
- **Dr. Carpenter** - Co-developer, clinical input

## LLM Context
**Preferred LLM for this project:** Claude

**What the LLM should know:**
- Collaboration project - decisions need buy-in from Dr. Carpenter
- Medical accuracy is critical
- PreOp_Optimizer is now a submodule

**What the LLM should NOT do:**
- Don't make major architectural decisions without noting they need Dr. Carpenter's input
- Don't assume clinical workflows without verification

## Notes & Ideas
- Consider HIPAA implications early
- May integrate with EMR workflows later
